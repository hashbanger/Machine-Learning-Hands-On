Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state-of-the art methods.

In very Simple terms:

It’s called sampling because for each arm, we pick (sample) a random CTR ratio from our current belief of its probability distribution, and then we sort the articles based on the sampled CTR.

Now what is this Probability distribution ?? The probability distribution is just a function that returns the odds of the CTR being any particular value.

And how does it looks like? Well, for a new article, we have no idea what the CTR is. It could be any number from 0 to 1. That’s called a uniform distribution. But every time we show an article, it’s like flipping an unfair coin. We flip it and see the result. Let’s say that if it’s head, we get a click. Every time we toss it and see the result, we can update our belief of the heads probability or article CTR.
So, what does it mean to use score = beta(clicks + 1, impressions - clicks + 1) ? We are just getting a random CTR, sampled from the beta distribution. We then sort the articles according to this randomised score. Articles that have a good CTR, will be shown (exploited) more often, but we will also explore new items as they come along. It’s amazing how simple it’s and how good the results are.

BACKWARD ELIMINATION PROCEDURE

Step 1: Select a significance level to stay in the model (e.g. SL = 0.05)

Step 2: Fit the full model all possible predictors.

Step 3: Consider the predictor with the highest P-Value. If P>SL, go to Step 4, otherwise go to FINAL.

Step 4: Remove the predictor

Step 5: Fit the model without this variable.
